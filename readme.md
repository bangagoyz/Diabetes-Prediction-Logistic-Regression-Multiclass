# Diabetes Prediction – Logistic Regression (Multiclass / Binary Classification)

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict diabetes using medical-related features.  
The core model used is **Logistic Regression**, evaluated in both multiclass and binary classification contexts.

The main workflow is implemented in the `Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb` notebook, including data exploration (EDA), preprocessing, imbalance handling, model training, and evaluation.
